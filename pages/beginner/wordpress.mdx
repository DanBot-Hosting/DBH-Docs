# Using & Hosting a Wordpress Site

WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes. WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to support other web content types including more traditional mailing lists and forums, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores. One of the most popular content management system solutions in use, WordPress is used by 42.8% of the top 10 million websites as of October 2021.

# Prerequisites

- A Domain
- [An NGINX server](/server/web-hosting/nginx) (link redirects to NGINX creation guide)
- A Database

## Installing Wordpress

Firstly, you need to download the Wordpress ZIP file, via [this link](https://wordpress.org/latest.zip), which is the latest version.

Once the download has finished, Head to your server via the [panel](https://panel.danbot.host/) and upload the Wordpress archive in the main root directory (`/home/container`).
Unarchive the file, and once it's done, delete the `webroot` folder and rename the unarchived Wordpress folder to `webroot`.

# Proxy the domain

To proxy the domain, kindly follow [this guide]() <> (my shift key broke and i cant write the path for the guide, ill see what i can do maybe its a software error)

<Redirect href="/beginner/proxying" />

Just in case you want to use the default given domain (`https://[NODE].danbot.host:[PORT]/`) you will most likely get the error

# Final setup

So now all you have to do is setup the **Wordpress**. Start the server and head to your website using the domain. Choose the preffered language, click `Continue`. Since **Wordpress** uses either MySQL or MariaDB you need to declare following items:

1. Database name
2. Database username
3. Database password
4. Database host
5. Table prefix (if you want to run more than one WordPress in a single database)

If you don't have a database, guess you need one. For that head to "Databases" tab on the server panel. From there click "NEW DATABASE" and think of a good name like "Wordpress"! When you're done get all the information fields and fill them as in the pictures:

## Finish the installation

After you've done, finish the installation: add the "site name", "author", "password" and "email". It can be whatever you want. Now you're ready to go and make your very own beautiful **Wordpress** website using its huge world of plugins and themes with DBH! You can check an example of a working DBH wordpress website here:
