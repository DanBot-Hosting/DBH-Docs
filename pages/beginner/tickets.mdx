# Support via Tickets

# How it Works

A Ticketing System is a management tool that processes and catalogs customer service requests. Tickets, also known as cases or issues, need to be properly stored alongside relevant user information. A DBH ticket system relies on its channels in the server. Currently the DBH Ticket System provides a way to create/close a ticket, upgrade/downgrade ticket priority/level and add/remove any user from the ticket.
## Submitting a Ticket

Firstly, you need to create a ticket, via this command: <Copy value="/open reason:" />. Please select the reason for the ticket, and provide adequate information regarding your issue.

## Contacting the Administrators Only

Since Moderators can't handle higher complexity issues, which involve more permissions: You can use the following command to "upgrade" the ticket to let only administrators see it! Command: <Copy value="/upgrade" />

To revert the changes and allow Moderators to view your ticket, use the following command: <Copy value="/downgrade" />

<Tip label="Good To Know">
  Always make sure you type your issue/problem into your ticket right away to
  be helped quicker!
</Tip>

## Adding Users to Your Ticket

If you require someone else, you can use the "add" command: <Copy value="/add-user user:<@user>" />
**Make sure to choose the correct user!**

### Removing Users From Your Ticket

You can remove any user, including moderation, using the following command: <Copy value="/remove-user user:<@user>" />

## Marking Your Ticket as Solved

If your case/issue has been solved, you need to close the ticket by clicking the "Close" button on the Embed that pops up when you make the ticket!
This embed should be found at the very top of the Ticket.

This step is required to keep DBH's ticketing system in order.

<Tip label="Good To Know">
  If you ever wanted to make a billion channels in the server you can't. The
  channel limit per server is 500 while the channel limit per category is 50.
  Category is also counted as a channel!
</Tip>

Having solved but not closed tickets may lead to a warn or a ban!
