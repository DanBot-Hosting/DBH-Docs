# Proxying Your Server to a Domain

Proxying might sound hard, but it's not! And this guide will show you how to proxy, step by step.
In this guide, [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) is used.

## Available DBH domains

<Tip label="Note">These domains are available for donators!</Tip>

- \*.only-fans.club
- \*.is-a-awesome.dev
- \*.is-a-cool.dev

## Setting up Your DNS Records

In order to proxy your domain to one of your servers, you need a DNS record.
![Add a record](/content/proxying/add-record.png)

After clicking "Add record" (as shown in the image above) you have to fill all of the fields as per the information below:

![Fill given fields](/content/proxying/proxy-fields.png)

<Tip>If you're using cloudflare consider turning off "Proxy Status".</Tip>

Consider adding these IPs:
| Name | IP |
| :---- | :---- |
| US 1 | <Copy value="69.197.135.202" /> |
| US 2 | <Copy value="69.197.135.203" /> |
| US 3 | <Copy value="69.197.135.204" /> |
| US 4 | <Copy value="69.197.135.205" /> |
| Donator 1 | <Copy value="69.30.249.53" /> |

<Tip>
  You only need one of the IP addresses above for the domain you want to proxy
  with!
</Tip>

After everything is done click "Save"!

## Proxying Via Discord:

Go to the DBH Discord server, and in a Commands channel, run:

        <DiscordMessages>
          <DiscordMessage
            author="Jonfirexbox"
            avatar="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66625200?v=4"
            roleColor="#00cfff"
            roleName="Client"
          >
            dbh!server proxy [domain] [server ID] 
          </DiscordMessage>
          <DiscordMessage
            author="DanBot Hosting"
            avatar="https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/9j2_RacvCl8mly7hALccyH0PsM-tbJYm8twQKGf_3jY/https/cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/640161047671603205/718aa5783508125a02e3b244a1bf096e.png"
            roleColor="#0329d3"
            bot={true}
            verified={false}
          >
            Domain has been proxied:

            ID: 555
            Location: United States 1 
          </DiscordMessage>
        </DiscordMessages>

<Tip>
  Make sure "domain" field doesn't have "http://" or "https://" in it!
  Example: `danbot.host` **not** `https://danbot.host`
</Tip>

After the Bot finishes and states that the domain has been proxied, please wait 1-5 minutes for the changes to take effect.

<Tip>
  If the Bot errors out when proxying, please
  consider contacting Moderation or Helpers to assist you with your issue.
  Before contacting staff, double check that all of the fields you filled in were filled correctly.
</Tip>
