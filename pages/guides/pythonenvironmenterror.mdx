# Fixing `EnvironmentError - No space left on device` Error

Please note that this **will not give you more disk space**, this will **increase your TEMP storage size**, which is what causes this error message.

## Prerequisites:

- PYTHON Server

## Directions:

On the PYTHON server, follow these steps:

Create a new directory, in the `home/container` directory, named `TEMP`

If your issue is occurring **whilst running PIP to install `requirements.txt`**, use:
```text
pip3 install --cache-dir="$HOME/TEMP/" -r requirements.txt
```

If your issue is occurring **whilst running code**, you need to export the `TEMP` directory, using:
```text
export TMPDIR=$HOME/TEMP
```

**Please note that the TMPDIR export will be wiped on reboot.**

## Making the TMPDIR permanent:

create a file, named `run.sh` and set its contents to:

```text
export TMPDIR=$HOME/TEMP

# replace this comment (this line) with your current Startup Command
```
Then set your Startup Command in the `Startup category` to `bash run.sh`


<Tip>Splitting up your `requirements.txt` file also helps out if you're getting this error whilst installing PIP packages.</Tip>

<Tip>Make sure your `run.sh` is in a directory which can reach any file listed in your Startup Command written to this file.</Tip>
