# Installing & Using NVM

## Installation guide:

- **Make sure the run script is set to 'bash' to be able to run these commands!**
- Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh`\
- Run `touch ~/.bashrc`\
- Run `bash install.sh`\
- Run `source ~/.bashrc`\
The installation process is ready!

## Usage:
You can directly use NVM in the command line, by typing `nvm`.
The [NVM readme](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) should explain most usage cases, but you can always use `nvm help` in the command line.
