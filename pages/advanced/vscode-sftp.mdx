# SFTP connection using VS Code

In computing, the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer, and file management over any reliable data stream. It was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol version 2.0 to provide secure file transfer capabilities.

## Installing the Required Extension

In order to connect to the SFTP using Visual Studio Code, you need the SFTP plugin fork by `Natizyskunk`.
Make sure it's that user's fork, as the old one is outdated and no longer maintained.

## Setting up

To start setting up the configuration, click `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then type `SFTP: Config`. This will open a file called `sftp.json`. In this file, you need to edit these values: "host", "port", "username", and "password". All of those can be found in the Settings tab in your server:

<Tip>
  Make sure you are editing files in `Explorer` and not `SFTP: Explorer`. The
  remote explorer is only used to view files, not edit.
</Tip>

## Synchronize files

To sync files from the panel to your folder, press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, and type `Sync Remote`. Choose `SFTP: Sync Remote -> Local`, then press enter and wait until all the files are synchronized.

<Tip label="Good To Know">
  If `uploadOnSave` is set to `true` in `sftp.json`, every time a file is
  saved when you're editing in Visual Studio Code, it will automatically be
  uploaded to the server.
