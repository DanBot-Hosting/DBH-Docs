# How to proxy a minecraft server

If you are looking of how to access your minecraft server without your server port, and using your own domain, you are at the right place

1. You need to have a minecraft server 
2. If you already use cloudflare you are good 👍 If you use your own domain dash, make sure that it allows you to create srv records
3. Create an srv record and fill the boxes with the information required:
```
Type: SRV
Name: [your subdomain name]
Service: _minecraft 
Protocol: TCP (remember tcp is only for java edition, bedrock uses udp)
TTL: auto
Priority: 0
Weight: 0
Port: [Your server port]
Target: [Domain name of the server] (most likely it will be dono-02.danbot.host)
```
Here is an example:
