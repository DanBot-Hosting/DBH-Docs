# How to proxy a minecraft server

This guide will show you how to access your Minecraft server (works with all eggs), whilst using your own domain.

# Requirements:
1. You need to have a minecraft server
2. It's better if you're using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), but any other domain dashboard will work, aslong as SRV Records are permitted.
3. Create an SRV Record and fill the boxes with the information required, as listed below:

```
Type: SRV
Name: [your subdomain name]
Service: _minecraft
Protocol: TCP/UDP (Choose one! TCP is used for Java Edition, whilst UDP is used for Bedrock Edition)
TTL: auto
Priority: 0
Weight: 0
Port: [Your server port]
Target: [Domain name of the server] (It will be either dono-02.danbot.host or dono-04.danbot.host)
```
<Tip>
  Make sure to fill in the information accordingly! Text in brackets () is a note, and shouldn't be listed in your code.
  Anything in the square brackets [] should be filled in with your information, removing the square brackets.
